This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# React Todo App

A simple react todo app that performs the following tasks:

* `List` items
* `Add` item
* `Edit` item
* `Remove` item
* `Mark` item as done/undone

Note: Currently the items are being stored in the browser's local storage rather than on the server.

## Demo & Example

You can find the live demo of the app [here](http://todolist-app-demo.herokuapp.com)
